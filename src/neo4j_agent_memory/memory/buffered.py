"""Buffered fire-and-forget writes for the agent's hot path.

Memory writes (recording reasoning steps, tool calls, MENTIONS edges)
block the agent's response on every turn when run synchronously. In
production deployments where the agent must respond to the user
*before* persistence completes, callers can opt into buffered writes:

* ``MemorySettings.memory.write_mode = "buffered"`` enables a background
  drainer.
* ``client.buffered.submit(query, params)`` queues a write and returns
  immediately.
* ``client.flush()`` drains the queue (call at shutdown or between
  hot-path bursts).
* ``client.wait_for_pending()`` blocks until in-flight workers are idle.
* ``client.write_errors`` exposes failures that occurred in the
  background.

Default behavior (``write_mode="sync"``) is a thin passthrough — every
``submit`` awaits the underlying ``execute_write`` directly. This keeps
tests deterministic and avoids surprise queueing in single-user demos.

Note that this is an *opt-in fire-and-forget* API. Memory APIs that
return values (e.g. ``add_step`` returning a ``ReasoningStep``) still
construct their Pydantic model synchronously and run the
``CREATE_REASONING_STEP`` write inline; only callers who want to
explicitly fire writes into the background reach for ``client.buffered``.
