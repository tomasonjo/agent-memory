# Financial Services Advisor

A multi-agent AI compliance investigation system powered by [Neo4j Agent Memory](https://github.com/neo4j-labs/agent-memory) Context Graphs. A supervisor agent orchestrates four specialist agents (KYC, AML, Relationship, Compliance) to investigate customers, detect money laundering patterns, trace shell company networks, and screen sanctions lists -- all backed by real Neo4j graph queries.

This example is implemented twice using different cloud AI platforms, demonstrating how the same graph-powered agent architecture works across providers:

| | [AWS Implementation](aws-financial-services-advisor/) | [Google Cloud Implementation](google-cloud-financial-advisor/) |
|-|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent Framework** | [AWS Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/) | [Google ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) |
| **LLM** | Amazon Bedrock (Claude Sonnet 4) | Google Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| **Embeddings** | Amazon Titan Embed V2 | Vertex AI text-embedding-004 |
| **Deployment** | AWS Lambda + CDK | Google Cloud Run |

Both implementations share the same sample data, Neo4j schema, tool implementations, and frontend design. Choose whichever matches your cloud platform.

## What It Does

Ask a question like *"Investigate customer CUST-003 for potential money laundering"* and the system:

1. **Supervisor** analyzes the request and delegates to specialist agents
2. **KYC Agent** verifies identity, checks documents, assesses customer risk factors
3. **AML Agent** scans transactions, detects structuring patterns (4x $9,500 cash deposits just under the $10K reporting threshold), identifies rapid fund movement and offshore layering
4. **Relationship Agent** maps the entity network via Neo4j graph traversal, detects shell companies (Cayman, Seychelles, BVI), traces beneficial ownership chains
5. **Compliance Agent** screens against sanctions lists, checks PEP status, generates SAR report drafts
6. **Supervisor** synthesizes all findings into a comprehensive risk assessment with recommendations

All tool results come from real Cypher queries against Neo4j -- not simulated data.

### Multi-Agent System

The supervisor orchestrates 4 specialist agents, each with Neo4j-backed tools:

| Agent | Tools | What It Queries |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **KYC** | `verify_identity`, `check_documents`, `assess_customer_risk`, `check_adverse_media` | Customer nodes, Document nodes, risk factors |
| **AML** | `scan_transactions`, `detect_patterns`, `flag_suspicious_transaction`, `analyze_velocity` | Transaction nodes -- detects structuring, rapid movement, layering |
| **Relationship** | `find_connections`, `analyze_network_risk`, `detect_shell_companies`, `map_beneficial_ownership` | Graph traversal across Organizations, ownership chains |
| **Compliance** | `check_sanctions`, `verify_pep_status`, `generate_sar_report`, `assess_regulatory_requirements` | SanctionedEntity, PEP nodes, regulatory frameworks |

### Three Memory Types

| Memory | Purpose | Stored In |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Short-Term** | Conversation history per session | Neo4j via `MemoryClient.short_term` |
| **Long-Term** | Customer entities and relationships | Neo4j via `MemoryClient.long_term` |
| **Reasoning** | Investigation audit trails with agent steps and tool calls | Neo4j via `MemoryClient.reasoning` |

### Neo4j Graph Schema

The sample data creates this graph structure:

```
(:Customer)-[:HAS_DOCUMENT]->(:Document)
(:Customer)-[:HAS_TRANSACTION]->(:Transaction)
(:Customer)-[:HAS_ALERT]->(:Alert)
(:Customer)-[:OWNS]->(:Organization)
(:Customer)-[:CONTROLS]->(:Organization)
(:Customer)-[:EMPLOYED_BY]->(:Organization)
(:Organization)-[:CONNECTED_TO]->(:Organization)
(:Organization)-[:LINKED_TO]->(:Organization)
(:Alert)-[:RELATED_TO_TRANSACTION]->(:Transaction)
(:SanctionedEntity)<-[:ALIAS_OF]-(:SanctionAlias)
(:PEPRelative)-[:RELATIVE_OF]->(:PEP)
```

---

## Sample Data

Both implementations share the same data in the [`data/`](data/) directory:

- **3 customers**: John Smith (low-risk individual), Maria Garcia (medium-risk import/export), Global Holdings Ltd (high-risk BVI corporate with shell company connections)
- **16 transactions**: Normal salary deposits, rapid wire movement patterns, 4x $9,500 cash deposits (structuring just under the $10K CTR threshold), offshore wire transfers
- **6 organizations**: Including Shell Corp - Cayman, Anonymous Trust - Seychelles, and Nominee Director Services Ltd with shell company indicators
- **3 sanctions entries**: OFAC SDN and EU Consolidated list entries with aliases
- **3 PEP entries**: Minister of Finance (Tier 1), Deputy PM (Tier 1), State Senator (Tier 2) with relatives
- **3 pre-built alerts**: Structuring (CRITICAL), shell company network (HIGH), rapid movement (MEDIUM)

---

## How the Two Implementations Differ

Both apps produce the same investigation results. The differences are in the agent framework and streaming model.

### Agent Delegation

**AWS Strands** uses explicit `@tool` delegation functions -- the supervisor has tools like `delegate_to_kyc_agent()` that create and invoke sub-agents:

```python
@tool
def delegate_to_kyc_agent(customer_id: str, task: str) -> dict:
    kyc_agent = _create_sub_agent("kyc", KYC_PROMPT, kyc_tools)
    result = kyc_agent(prompt)
    return {"agent": "kyc", "findings": str(result)}

supervisor = Agent(model=BedrockModel(...), tools=[delegate_to_kyc_agent, ...])
```

**Google ADK** uses native sub-agent delegation -- the framework handles routing automatically:

```python
kyc_agent = LlmAgent(name="kyc_agent", model=model, tools=[...])
supervisor = LlmAgent(name="supervisor", sub_agents=[kyc_agent, aml_agent, ...])

async for event in Runner.run_async(user_id, session_id, message):
    # Real-time events as each sub-agent executes
```

### SSE Streaming

This is the primary UX difference:

| | AWS | Google Cloud |
|-|-----|-------------|
| **During investigation** | Loading spinner (supervisor blocks until done) | Live animated cards showing each agent activating, calling tools, accessing memory |
| **Event types** | 5 (start, complete, response, trace, done) | 11 (+ delegate, tool_call, tool_result, memory_access, thinking) |
| **Why** | Strands `agent(prompt)` is synchronous | ADK `Runner.run_async()` is an async generator |

Both frontends use the same Framer Motion components (`AgentOrchestrationView`, `ToolCallCard`, `MemoryAccessIndicator`), but the GCP version shows richer real-time activity.

### Reasoning Traces

Both record reasoning traces to Neo4j after each chat. The GCP version captures more detail (1 step per sub-agent with nested tool calls) because ADK exposes per-agent events during execution.

### Everything Else Is the Same

- Same `Neo4jDomainService` with ~30 Cypher query methods
- Same 16 tool functions (KYC, AML, Relationship, Compliance)
- Same `bind_tool()` pattern to inject `neo4j_service` while hiding it from the LLM
- Same FastAPI backend structure and API endpoints
- Same React + Chakra UI v3 frontend
- Same `MemoryClient` integration for all three memory types
